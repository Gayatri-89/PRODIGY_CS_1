# PRODIGY_CS_1
# PRODIGY_CS_01 - Caesar Cipher Encryption and Decryption Tool

This is my **first task** for the Cybersecurity Internship at **Prodigy InfoTech**.

## 🔐 Project Description

This project is a GUI-based application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using the **Caesar Cipher** technique. The Caesar Cipher is a classic substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

The app uses **Python** and **Tkinter** for the GUI.

## 💡 Features

- Encrypt text using Caesar Cipher
- Decrypt text with a given shift key
- Reset button to clear inputs
- Simple and user-friendly GUI using Tkinter

---

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI)

- 📚 What I Learned
Implementing Caesar Cipher logic for both encryption and decryption

Designing a functional GUI using Tkinter

Handling user inputs and exceptions gracefully

Using modular code for better readability
